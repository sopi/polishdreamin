  <summary>Custom Field for First Contact Time</summary>
Guide me through salesforce admin steps to create to create a custom date-time field on the Lead object to record the exact time when a lead is first contacted. This could be named something like "First Contact Time."

  <summary>Automation for Tracking First Contact</summary>

Use Salesforce's Process Builder or Flow to automate the process of capturing the first contact time. The automation should be triggered when a lead is contacted for the first time. Depending on how your organization defines "contact" (e.g., a call, email, or meeting logged in Salesforce), you can set the appropriate criteria for the automation. When the criteria are met, the automation updates the "First Contact Time" field with the current timestamp.

Please guide me through the Salesforce developer steps to create a live digital clock showing the elapsed time from lead creation until the first contact on the lead detail page. The first contact time (First_Contact_Time__c) field exists on a lead. It can be empty or filled. This component would dynamically display the time elapsed since the lead's creation, updating in real-time as you view the page as a digital clock that will work as a clock showing the live elapsed time when browsing a lead page. It would freeze once the first contact has been made, showing the final elapsed time. Additionally, the background should be changed based on elapsed time: below 24h green, below 48h orange, and the rest red.
Examples of displayed elapsed time:
1: 05h 03m 21s
2: 1d 06h 03m 21s
3: 1s 
4: 2m 34s
5: 4h 2m 34s
```

### Flows:
Clear instructions Set vs. update :) When talking to person that understands Flows can use this interchangeably: we know to set connection, but AI doesnâ€™t know, and when we write update i tries to solve it and make an update.
